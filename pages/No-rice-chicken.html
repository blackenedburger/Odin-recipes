    <p>This looks like a low carb rice alternative, I am eager to make it and try it.  
        The chicken and cauliflower together seem like a healthy alternative to too much rice. Another recipe i have 
        been meaning to try is an alternative to a pizza crust using cauliflower 
        so if this is really good then i will definately consider making a pizza crust out of the plant
        well. I love chinese food and if this is a tasty type of it then I am more than happy to use it for one 
        my planned meals during the week if I am looking for something rice like and do not want to make rice.</p>
