                <p><h1>No Rice, Chicken Fried Rice</h1></p>
             
                <p>This is a low carb alternative, the chicken and cauliflower together are 
                    a healthy alternative to rice. I love chinese food and this is a tasty type of it
                     and if you are looking for something rice like and do not want to make rice
                     then this is perfect and can easily be adjusted for your own personal spice
                     preferences.</p>
